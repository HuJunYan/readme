People joke about what IDE they use often, things like Word, MS Notepad, sometimes even _Eclipse_, and then often times MS Paint. People joke about MS Paint because it's not even a text editor, people joke about it because it doesn't have one feature in common with IDEs. Well, this application gives MS Paint a boost, and lets MS Paint highlight, compile, and execute code, with just a few clicks of a button, and only text coming from MS Paint. It is now much more practical than things like Word, Notepad, and obviously _Eclipse_.

## Features

MS Paint IDE has grown an insane amount over the past year, and I plan for it to grow even more in the following year. Currently, these are some of the features present in MS Paint IDE:

- Can read, parse, and highlight code from purely image files
- Finding and replacing of text from image files
- Supports Java, Python, JavaScript, and Go, with many more planned
  - Includes [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support alongside a very simple language API to add custom languages
- Git tools, to create and manage your project in Git from within the IDE
- Google Assistant support
- Right-click context menu to open and edit ANY text file in an MS Paint instance
- Integrated buttons within MS Paint (No program modifications) to do basic IDE tasks
- Native installer for easy usage
- Full Discord RPC Support
- IDE theming via CSS files

## How It Works

MS Paint IDE is an application that runs alongside MS Paint that reads its images you make from MS Paint. It then uses a custom [OCR](https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/NewOCR/) to read, parse, highlight, and execute the text. All output files and logs are created as images, to show you the program output, and compilation/interpretation output.

## Wiki

Every feature, button, usage instructions, and whatever you want is on the wiki, which is the best place to start if you're interested in trying out the IDE. [https://wiki.ms-paint-i.de/](https://wiki.ms-paint-i.de/)

The wiki also includes screenshots of nearly everything, with videos coming soon upon the final 3.0.0 release.

## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome, and for setting up the repository locally, there's a wiki page walking through the whole process: [https://wiki.ms-paint-i.de/developing](https://wiki.ms-paint-i.de/developing)
