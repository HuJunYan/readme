Genesis is an extraordinary dimension which includes the time of the Precambrian (4500 Ma) until the end of the Cretaceous period (66 Ma). It consists of many unique biomes, realistic flora, a phenomenal diversity of animal species and new mechanisms.

### Environment
Rich, strange and hostile, the Genesis dimension is a primitive world where there are dinosaurs, primitive mammals, giant insects, marine and flying reptiles, enigmatic animals, giant mushrooms, seed ferns, trees without wood and very old lava and rocks.

The dimension is composed of many biomes as swamp rainforest, rainforest, marsh, woodlands, Araucarioxylon forest, Metasequoia forest, shallow ocean, floodplains forest, red desert and others. Each biome represents a period stage in the prehistory (eg: woodlands = Maastrichtien), characterized by a realistic flora and fauna. The peculiarities of plants, their edibility, their effects, the character of animals, their way of life, are the result of scientific research, assumptions and comparison with the current biodiversity.

The main rock is granite, but there are several rock type as the gneiss, rhyolite, dolerite, anorthosite, limestone and others, generated in layers. The generation of the caves have been reworked. The underground is composed of large komatiitic lava lakes with some small islets.

Oceans may be composed of aquatic plants, corals, ooze for the floor, smokers, fishes, marine reptiles and strange small animals.

### How to survive
You can't access at the dimension if you wear items on you. However, you can report Genesis items in Overworld. To activate the portal, you need to find "relics" of ancient structures generated in taiga biomes. The portal is a wormhole surrounded by 4 menhirs. Each menhir requires an special offering (=relic).<br />
As soon as you arrived on Genesis, you must look pebbles near rivers or oceans to obtain a chopping-tool by hitting the pebble against a hard rock. This a very primitive tool that allows you to break the wood. With this wood, you can build a workbench for knapping stones and make a campfire. Find a cave or a fairly safe place and begin knapping the toolhead from the pebbles. There are many types of rock, each with different properties. You can use granite, rhyolite, quartz, dolerite, brown or black flint. To finish creating the tool, you need wood billets and fibers. The fibers are found on plants called Sphenophyllum. They usually grow in wetlands. When you create a toolhead, it has quality "chipped." They can then be polished on a polissoir to improve its properties.

To feed, you can start with small dinosaurs hunt or gather wild fruits and rhizomes in nature. It is best to cook your meat to improve the quality of it and so you don't get sick. To start the campfire, you need to use a flint and marcasite. Both stones can be obtained in the form of nodules in limestone.

You can make weapons like the spear, knife, self bow, composite bow, wooden arrow (light) or bone arrow (heavy). The choice of wood of your bow will also give different properties.

A house becomes necessary to store resources, have your garden and be safe. To build the walls, you can use the wattle and daub create from dung and Programinis. Use log to the corners. You can also use the rubble to create more robust walls. For the roof, you can choose between the Programinis or Calamites roof. Convert indoor with item racks to place your best items, storage boxes to store your resources or jar to create fermented dishes.

To catch a animal, you need to use a bola. Throwing the bola on the animal, you have some chance to immobilize the animal. It is then possible to prepare him to become a pet. Pets can lead to improve their capabilities (eg: a Coelophysis likes to play at the throwing bone). You also can make animal farms through eggs that appear on plants or in nests. Certain animals give hides to make clothing. The hide need to be tanned before on a tanning rack.

You can also make ceramic pottery like bowls, vessels or cooking pots. With plants, fruits, mushrooms and other resources, you can make porridge, stews and dyes in a cooking pot placed on the campfire.

Finally, if you are interested by the supernatural, you can use the altar to obtaining power on items and achieve effects on the environment.

Genesis still full of many secrets that you will discover during your adventure.
