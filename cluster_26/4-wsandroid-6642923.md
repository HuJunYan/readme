## How may I help the project?

We’re very happy that you are thinking about helping us!
A great starting point would probably be to join us in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/warmshowers-wsandroid/Lobby), but you can also have a look through our [Issues](https://github.com/warmshowers/wsandroid/issues) and especially the ones labelled [Help needed](https://github.com/warmshowers/wsandroid/labels/Help%20needed)

If you find something within the code you’d like to see changed for performance, security, accessibility, data protection, or whatever reason you see fit: Please feel free to fork the project and send us a pull request once you’re done with your changes.

### Things that are always helpful

* More translations (see [#234](https://github.com/warmshowers/wsandroid/issues/234))
  * We currently support English, German, French, and Spanish
  * Currently, we do not use Transifex, POEditor, or other services but as soon as someone would like to help, we’re going to look into it

* Tests of any kind—UI tests, unit tests, integration tests, you name it

## OSS libraries in use (aka, Thank You!)

Without these libraries, our lives would be a whole lot more difficult. So thank you all for developing and maintaining those fine pieces of software!
