### Đeco2800: Farm

Welcome to the world of **ĐecoFarm** (or FarmSim2800). **ĐecoFarm** is an interactive and realistic farming management simulation game that has been developed for users enjoyment. Users have the ability to hire and manage workers, clear land, plant and farm crops. We have gone to great lengths in order to keep this farm simulation game as realistic as possible. Examples include a day and night cycle to reflect real life, though the game isn’t a 1:1 ratio in terms of seconds and minutes in the real world, we believe we have constructed a suitable timing system that not only allows users to play at a much faster pace but by constructing it in this way we haven’t compromised one of main goals; realistic.  While working in conjunction with the marketplace, users have the ability to buy and sell items such as tools, machinery, animal products and crops. The financial element on selling and buying products has been simulated in the form of supply and demand. By this, if there is a high demand for apples, and a low supply, a high price will follow. This further emphasises the realistic vibe we are trying to achieve in this simulation. 

There are no set guidelines in order to play our simulation, our main goal was to make the game fun and challenging for all users. There are however, choices that users have to make throughout the game, such as what tech tree advancements should be researched or what plants to grow during which season; to name a few. With all games variety and choices are required, because with these attributes each simulation becomes unique. For example, if a user only wants to be a dairy farm, thus they would have a high number of cows and would supply the market place with milk and possibly beef if they so choose. This would then require another user to focus more on sheep, or pigs otherwise they would flood the market with one specific product and cause it to be devalued. 

In terms of design, we have opted for a 2.5D styled game, this further emphasises the realistic atmosphere we were trying achieve. We ensured that a group consensus was made when developing the game to guarantee no visual elements (whether they are an animal, crop or even building) looked out of place. On a final note, we hope that you enjoy the game and have lots of fun!

At the request of some contributors, this repo was rehosted and the commit graph flattened. As a consequence, we've lost contributor history. See CONTRIBUTORS for a list of contributors order by number of commits, and CONTRIBUTORS.png for a screenshot of the old repo's contributors graph.
