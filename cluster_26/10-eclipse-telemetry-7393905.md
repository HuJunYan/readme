### Using the app on Linux
Depending on the version of Linux you use, the app might not have the required permissions to use devices connected on serial ports. Start by identifying the connected device's group owner and add yourself to this group (the group might be `dialout`). Then, after restarting your computer, the app should have access to the serial ports.

The connected devices are normally reported under `/dev/`. This also where the app looks for connected devices.

To add yourself to the desired group, use `sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>`.
